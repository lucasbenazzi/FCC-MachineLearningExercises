# FCC-MachineLearningExercises
Machine Learning exercises for the **"Machine Learning with Python"** course on **FreeCodeCamp.org**
All exercises were done on Google Colab.

Main libraries used: **TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib.**

## Exercises sumarry:
### fcc_book_recommendation_knn.ipynb
* Book recommendation algorithm using K-Nearest Neighbors. It used a dataset containing 1.1 million ratings (1 to 10) of 270.000 books by 90.000 users.

### fcc_cat_dog.ipynb
* Convolutional neural network to correctly classify cats and dogs. Since the training data was relativly small, the MobileNetV2 model was used.

### fcc_predict_health_costs_with_regression.ipynb
* Health cost prediction using a regression algorithm. It used a small dataset with the following information: age, sex, bmi, nÂ° of children, smoker, region and expenses.

### fcc_sms_text_classification.ipynb
* LSTM model to classify texts as spam or not. It used a simple dataset with a text and classification (spam or not spam)
